Best to start it shortly after 9am, starting it late in the evening
can leave the voices a liittllee slllooowww.

    I don’t need no speed, no
    I don’t need no heroin, no thanks
    I don’t want no coke, not today
    You can keep your ketamine, yeah
    I’m a bassline junkie, what?
    I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
    I’m a bassline junkie, tell them again
    And I like it funky
